# Demo Store Completion - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Kin Workspace e-commerce platform is 85% complete with core functionality already implemented. This spec focuses on completing the remaining 15% to create a fully functional demo store that can run locally without external dependencies while being production-ready.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Demo Payment System

**User Story:** As a demo user, I want to complete realistic purchase transactions without real money, so that I can experience the full e-commerce flow safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates checkout THEN the system SHALL present a demo payment form with clear "DEMO MODE" indicators
2. WHEN a user enters demo credit card information THEN the system SHALL validate the form and simulate processing delays
3. WHEN a demo payment is processed THEN the system SHALL create a real order in the database with demo payment status
4. IF a demo payment fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and allow retry
5. WHEN a demo payment succeeds THEN the system SHALL redirect to order confirmation with demo receipt
6. WHEN the system is in production mode THEN the payment service SHALL seamlessly switch to real Stripe processing

### Requirement 2: Order Management Interface

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to view and manage my order history, so that I can track purchases and reorder items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the orders page THEN the system SHALL display all their orders with filtering options
2. WHEN a user clicks on an order THEN the system SHALL show detailed order information including items, addresses, and status
3. WHEN an order status changes THEN the system SHALL update the visual status indicator and timeline
4. WHEN a user wants to reorder THEN the system SHALL add all order items to their current cart
5. WHEN a user views order details THEN the system SHALL provide options to print or download receipts
6. IF an order is in pending status THEN the system SHALL allow order cancellation

### Requirement 3: CMS Integration

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want products to sync from our existing CMS, so that product information stays current and centralized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL connect to the configured CMS and sync product data
2. WHEN CMS data is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in the product catalog
3. IF the CMS is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to local product data
4. WHEN a manual sync is triggered THEN the system SHALL update all product information from the CMS
5. WHEN images are synced from CMS THEN the system SHALL optimize and cache them locally
6. WHEN product categories change in CMS THEN the system SHALL update navigation and filtering

### Requirement 4: Demo Mode Experience

**User Story:** As a demo viewer, I want clear indicators that this is a demonstration, so that I understand the context and limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is in demo mode THEN it SHALL display "DEMO MODE" indicators throughout the interface
2. WHEN demo data needs to be reset THEN the system SHALL provide a reset function to restore initial state
3. WHEN a user completes the demo flow THEN the system SHALL provide sample data for orders, reviews, and user accounts
4. WHEN demonstrating features THEN the system SHALL include realistic but clearly fake data
5. WHEN switching to production THEN the system SHALL remove all demo indicators and use real services

### Requirement 5: Production Readiness

**User Story:** As a developer, I want easy production deployment, so that the demo can be quickly converted to a live store.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are changed THEN the system SHALL switch from demo to production mode
2. WHEN in production mode THEN the system SHALL use real payment processing, email services, and external APIs
3. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality
4. WHEN production services fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully with appropriate user feedback
5. WHEN scaling for production THEN the system SHALL maintain performance and security standards
